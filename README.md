# Operational-Workflow-Automation-Simulator

This project simulates how repetitive manual workflows can be automated through using Python.

### How it works:
- Loads incoming requests from a CSV file
- Applies simple business rules
- Automatically approves or rejects requests
- Outputs a processed file with results

### Why I built this:
I wanted to explore how automation can reduce the manual effort in operational environments, especially in government-style workflows.

### What I learned from this project:


### Future improvements
- Add database storage
- Add logging and error handling
- Simulate real-time input
